            <br>
            <p>This is the home page of my self-introduction website, 
                a Computer Science major student persuing bachlor degree at The City College of New York
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>There isn't that much to speak about myself I think in the professional setting, I probably have the common skills that other computer science 
                major have and DON't have the special ones that others might possess, such as COBOL, RUST, etc. (I'll save them when I come across them).
