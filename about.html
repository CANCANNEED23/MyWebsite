            <h2>Who Am I?</h2>
            <p>I'm an immigrant from China, came to the United States when I was just a kid. I'm probably not a very interesting guy, I love gaming, reading
                books, and learning random things. I joined the Computer Science major because of they creativity I see in the field, as a software engineer
                or developer, or just coding in general, it all can be seen as a process of creating.
            </p>

            <p>It's weird to not talk about what I know about computer science or introduce myself on my abilities in programming but I find that too
                repeitive, since everyone else is doing that, so I'll tell you that I'm in the process of planning to write a book, probably be a simple one,
                in the genre of realistic fiction, it will be about a course where students learn how to write fictions, fantasy, sci-fi, etc. For me it will be 
                a expression on my thoughts about how science and scientific thinking are lost in creative writing, even though they are the fundamental knowledge 
                human have on the world. (Computer science is a science, so I should be able to call myself a scientist, right?)
